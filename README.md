# Hi, I'm Syafiq! ðŸ‘‹

## ðŸš€ About Me
I am a non IT graduate who aspires to be a front-end developer. I've taken several online courses and personal
projects to improve my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as learned frameworks like React JS and Next JS. I
love the challenge and opportunity to create an attractive and functional web interface.
