# Hi, I'm Syafiq! ðŸ‘‹

## ðŸš€ About Me
Frontend Engineering works with HTML, CSS, and React Js to implement designs from UI/UX into website with the right size then deploy to hosting.
I can collaborate with teammates in version control systems such as GitHub, manage responsiveness with CSS frameworks, consumes restful API, and use redux as global state management.
I have the motivation to work as a front-end developer because it has challenges to solve problems.
